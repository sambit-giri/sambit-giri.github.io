<h2 class="major">About</h2>
<p>
    I am a passionate cosmologist dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of the universe, 
    with a focus on galaxy formation and its connection to cosmology. My research spans 
    from exploring the conditions in the early universe and the emergence of first light 
    sources to studying the distribution of matter across the cosmos. Through my work, 
    I strive to contribute valuable insights into the fundamental nature of our universe 
    and its captivating evolution over time.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving">Flammarion engraving</a> 
    created with the help of Dr H. E. Ross for the cover page of 
    <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1289039&dswid=-7198">my PhD thesis</a>.
    The Flammarion engraving is an allegory representing humanity's curiosity and fascination with the universe, 
    as well as the desire to explore and understand it. Our version envisions that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) 
    will play a pivotal role in advancing our quest for understanding the cosmos. This creation was featured in 
    SKA observatory's magazine, <a href="https://issuu.com/ska_telescope/docs/contact_-_issue_01">Contact issue 01</a>.
